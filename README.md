# AND Coding Challenges

This repository contains my solutions for a number of coding challenges.

## Challenge 1: "Control C, Control V"

Requirements: Python 3 (written with 3.8)

* Data input file: `challenge1.json` - input format should be a syntactically valid JSON file containing a simple array 
of strings to process.
* To run: `python challenge1.py`. The results for each line will be printed to STDOUT.
* To run unit tests: `python challenge1_tests.py`

If you prefer to [see the run results on GitHub actions, you can](https://github.com/stwalkerster/and-coding-challenges/actions/workflows/challenge1.yml)!
